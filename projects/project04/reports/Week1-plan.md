## Next Steps - Latent Mapping of Developmental Trajectories
First I need to check about the repository on Github, and try again to link it to my local repository.

For the next few day I will try to develop the first phase of the project, so I need to focus on downloading the initial data in order to start looking and polish the code I already have. It means I need to look about quality control, so need to check if the data are correct, consistent and usable. I am going to focus on correctly loaded the files, try to look if the files open properly, look about the shape, inside I will look and detect if there are over or blurry frames. At the end I will try to plot a few random frames per embryo for QC.

Then when I get a nice and a correct data, I will explore which are the principal per-frame descriptors, need to look if I am considering every descriptor. Add more features: entropy, Laplacian variance, at least all of them like the autonomous-work. When I identify the descriptors, I am going to plot descriptors trends and compare on each embryo I have. This will improve the code and try to make it more sophisticated. 

On other step, to create a baseline dimensionality reduction and trajectories, this is for explore latent structure with PCA, UMPA, t-SNE, and also check the developmental trajectories. So in order to do it well i need to standardize features with some technique, probably Standard Scaler, try on differents features and if is good look for another one. After, I am going to create the scatter plots by each of the methods follow. I will look if all the metrics are good because it is necessary to write a page summary of findings for future conclusions.

If I have enough time i will started to looking if I can set the autoencoders, probably this will be one of the extensive and difficult parts of the project, because this is the step where I will have the latent trajectories and also look if both: convolutional and the variational autoencoders are going to get into the study. When I finally get the outputs (latent vectors) and work again with the PCA/UMAP for visualization and know if all the characteristics are fitting good. Maybe here I can compute latent-time correlations and look if other metrics can complete the code.
