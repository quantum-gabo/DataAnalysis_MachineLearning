## Research Proposal - Latent Mapping of Developmental Trajectories

Zebrafish embryos suffer rapid developmental transformations, progressing through characteristic stages such as blastula and gastrula, which are well established in the literature. These stages are characterized by distinct morphological changes including area growth, axis elongation, and tissue patterning, which can affect the genetic mutations leading to pathways such as Nodal or BMP. From a computational perspective, image sequences of these embryos are rich in spatiotemporal structure that’s why in recent studies using deep learning for embryo phenotyping have demonstrated that neural models can predict developmental stages or discriminate mutants directly from raw images.

## Research Questions>
The aim of this research is to learn and study how low-dimensional latent spaces can organize the zebrafish embryo development across time. For the develop of the project I need to set first the following research questions: Can we create separable clusters or divergent paths based on control and mutant embryos images? Can we develop a latent space in which time progress smoothly for each embryo in order to characterize them? Which of the techniques are the best one for learn and capture developmental progression?

The real data I am going to use are the brightfield time-lapse videos of 150 zebrafish embryos (normal, Nodal mutant, BMP mutant), 2–16 hpf, 1 frame/5 min. Initially we will first perform quality control and compute a series of morphological descriptors that summarize embryo dynamics across time, but for the construction of the best code firstly we are going to use a reduced data, that consists of six image stacks representing different genotypes: two controls, two mutant A embryos, and two mutant B embryos.

## The plan we will follow splits in three main phases:

Phase 1: focuses on quality control and descriptor computation, where I will verify that all image stacks load correctly as three-dimensional arrays with consistent orientation and inspect random frames. If segmentation masks are available, they will be applied to isolate the embryo region. For each frame, I will compute a set of intensity-based features: mean, standard deviation,percentiles, entropy; texture and edge-based measures: Laplacian variance for sharpness and Sobel gradient statistics, and, when masks are available, shape-based descriptors such as area, major and minor axes, and aspect ratio. Descriptor trends will then be plotted over time for each embryo and compared across genotypes.

Phase 2: establishes baseline structure through dimensionality reduction, so after standardizing features, I will apply PCA, UMAP, and t-SNE to project descriptors into two dimensions or less dimensions. PCA will provide a global linear projection, while UMAP and t-SNE will emphasize local continuity and cluster separation, respectively. For each embryo, points will be sorted temporally and connected to form trajectories in the embedded space. This phase will help visualize whether developmental progression appears smooth and whether mutants diverge from controls focusing on the classification.

Phase 3: refers to deep latent modeling with autoencoders. When will be possible, background will be reduced via masking, if not I need to continue without masking. The first model, a convolutional autoencoder, will include an encoder with three convolutional layers (32, 64, and 128 filters). The decoder will mirror this structure with transposed convolutions, reconstructing the original image. Training will use mean-squared error, and batches will mix frames from multiple embryos. A second option will be the variational autoencoder, where I will introduce probabilistic latent variables with separate mean and log-variance heads to encourage smooth, continuous manifolds. Once trained, the encoder will produce latent vectors z(t) for each frame.

For the evaluation I will consider multiple quantitative aspects, one of them as the reconstruction quality will be qualify using mean-squared error, per frame and per genotype, we can add another metrics during the development. Temporal organization will be examined by computing the correlation between latent coordinates or principal component and frame index, as well as by measuring average step size and curvature of latent trajectories. Genotype separability will be measured using k-nearest-neighbor accuracy and silhouette scores in latent space. Divergence analysis will involve computing mean trajectories per genotype and measuring distances between these curves using Hausdorff or average point-to-curve metrics, identifying the earliest time at which mutants deviate beyond a set threshold. These analyses will be repeated using descriptor-based embeddings for baseline comparison.

I expect that descriptor-based dimensionality reduction will reveal partially separated but overlapping genotype clusters, with smooth trajectories that suggest temporal progression. Mutant trajectories are expected to deviate from controls and the autoencoder derived latent spaces should yield clearer temporal organization, improved genotype separability, and lower reconstruction error, especially for control embryos.

Experimental design emphasizes reproducibility and transparency so the first six embryos will serve as a small but representative pilot set, with metrics computed per embryo and summarized by genotype. To prevent overfitting or inflated performance, GroupKFold cross-validation will be applied consistently wherever supervision is involved. I will report both naïve and no-leakage scores to illustrate the impact of leakage control. All computations will use Python locally on Jupyter notebook and standard scientific libraries such as NumPy, pandas, scikit-image, scikit-learn, umap-learn, TensorFlow/Keras, and matplotlib. 

Random seeds will be fixed, hyperparameters logged.
